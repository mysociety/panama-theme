<ul>
<li>You didn't get a reply within 20 working days</li>
<li>You did not get all of the information that you requested <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>Your request was refused, but without a reason valid under the law</li>
</ul>

<p>... you can</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask for an <strong>internal review</strong> at the public authority.</li>
<li>If that doesn't help, forward the case to <strong>ANTAI</strong>.</li>
<li>Either way, also <strong>use other means</strong> to answer your question.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="internal_review">1. Asking for an internal review <a class="hover_a" href="#internal_review">#</a> </h1>

<p>
<% if !@info_request.nil? %>
    <%= link_to "Request an internal review", show_response_no_followup_path(:id => @info_request.id, :incoming_message_id => nil) + "?internal_review=1#followup", :class => 'link_button_green' %> and then write a message asking the authority to review your request.
<% else %>
    At the bottom of the relevant request page on <%= site_name %> choose
    "request an internal review". Then write a message asking for an internal
    review of your request. You may want to include a link to the
    request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about.
<% end %>
</p>

<p>Internal reviews should be quick. If one takes longer than 20 working days
then the authority should write and let you know, and it should never take
longer than 40 working days.
You will then either get the information that
you originally requested, or you will be told that the review upholds the
original decision.

<h1 id="antai">2. Forwarding the case to ANTAI <a class="hover_a" href="#antai">#</a> </h1>

<p>If you are still unhappy after the public authority has done their internal review,
then you can forward the case to ANTAI. To do this: <strong>TODO</strong>.
</p>

<p><%= site_name %> has no special facilities for handling a request at this stage - it
passes into ANTAI's system. You can leave annotations on your
request keeping people informed of progress.</p>

<p>You can also try and get the information by <strong>other means...</strong></p>

<h1 id="other_means">3. Using other means to answer your question <a class="hover_a" href="#other_means">#</a> </h1>

<p>You can try persuing your problem or your research in other ways.

<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>new ATI request</strong> for summary information, or for
documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
<a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Ask us for ideas</a> if you're stuck.</li>
<li>If any <strong>other public authorities</strong> or publicly owned companies are involved,
then make ATI requests to them.</li>
<li>Ask <strong>other researchers</strong> who are interested in a similar
issue to yours for ideas. You can sometimes find them by browsing this site;
contact any registered user from their page. There may be an Internet
forum or group that they hang out in.</li>
</ul>
